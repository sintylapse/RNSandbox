# React Native sandbox
A RN template based on react-native-navigation. You can use it for initializing your project, or quick testing some libs.

## React Native build notes

#### Build and debug
- Plug device in
- Use adb reverse to prevent errors:
```
cd C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
```
#### Build Debug APK
- go to android
```
cd android
```
- generate the build using gradle
```
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
- generated APK is situated at ..\android\app\build\outputs\apk

### Use to build .apk publish version
- place tbins-release-key.keystore to android/app folder (for keystore generation see https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html)
```
npm run deploy:android
```
- then install it to device:
```
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk
```
###Testing the release build of your app
Before uploading the release build to the Play Store, make sure you test it thoroughly. First uninstall any previous version of the app you already have installed. Install it on the device using:
```
react-native run-android --variant=release
```

### Notes

```
